								<h1>this is about my<strong>Project Ideas</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>One of my goals is inventing an application that helps students in highschool to study.
							The app will contain videos of materials that are taught in school.
							Students can easily revise the materials they got from school so there will be less bad marks.
							It will also come with different curriculums so students from any school with various curriculums could be helped.
							I will also looking forward for the usability of the app since user's experience is the main key for successful apps.
							Therefore, students will enjoy studying using the app I made.
							<br>
							It will be designed both for mobile and web version to make it more handy.
							Hopefully it can be come true someday and also it can create impacts in education area.
