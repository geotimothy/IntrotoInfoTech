								<h1>Hi. I'm <strong>Geoffrey Timothy</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>And this is <strong>Me</strong>, a fresh graduate from a highschool called <a href="https://www.iphschools.sch.id/"><strong>IPH</strong></a>, Located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surabaya"><strong>Surabaya</strong></a> City, East Java, <a href="https://www.indonesia.travel/gb/en/home"><strong>Indonesia.</strong></a> I also live in the same city where i went to highschool.
							<br>
							I'm also an <strong>ESFP-T</strong> according to the Myers Briggs test from  <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"><strong>16 Personalities Website</strong></a>
							<br>
							<img src = "images/Screenshot(226).png" >
							<br>
							so I'm
							<br>
							<strong>Practical,</strong>I like to do something that is real and suits the current condition(more practical than theoretical).
							<br>
							<strong>Original,</strong> I feel happy when I create something by my own ideas.
							<br>							
							<strong>Appreciate people,</strong> I appreciate people's work whatever it is.</p>
							<p><strong>Why RMIT?</strong>
							<br>because RMIT is an institute that teaches its students in practical way so that students are well-prepared for the real working world 
							<br>and i guess that RMIT is the type of university that I'm looking for because it will help me for my future.
							<br>I'm the type of guy who is not interested in researching and figuring out something new but I'm more to prepare myself for work and living my life.
							<br><strong>Why choosing IT at RMIT?</strong>
							<br>Technology is what the world needs in the near future so I decided to learn IT and make some technology development that could be useful for people in the future.
							<br><strong>Was there any particular event or person which sparked your interest?</strong>
							<br> Technically there wasn't any event or anyone that sparked my interest. 
							<br> It is purely because of my thoughts about technology is the future world.
							<br><strong>What do you expect learing during your studies ?</strong>
							<br>I expext to learn how to think like a technologist and have a mindset that is futuristic so this will help me in creating products in the future.
							<br>I also want to expand my network so that I could have friends from another country as well as learning about culture differences.

								<h1>this is about my <strong>Project Ideas</strong>.</h1>
							</header>
							<p>One of my goals is inventing an application that helps students in highschool to study.
							The app will contain videos of materials that are taught in school.
							Students can easily revise the materials they got from school so there will be less bad marks.
							It will also come with different curriculums so students from any school with various curriculums could be helped.
							I will also looking forward for the usability of the app since user's experience is the main key for successful apps.
							Therefore, students will enjoy studying using the app I made.
							<br>
							It will be designed both for mobile and web version to make it more handy.
							Hopefully it can be come true someday and also it can create impacts in education area.

						<h1><b> How and when the "Interest" come ? </b></h1>
						<p>This job security that makes me have my interest in IT and I realised it since my year 11 of highschool.
						What I need to remember is the future world is all about IT and Development of Technology.
						<br>
						The first spark was when I heard about the Security System and Data Science.
						These two fields pump my curiosity into IT because firstly, when you are mastering the security system you could know how hackers work and how to tackle their work.
						The other field which is Data Science could give you a specific clue about what's gonna come in near future. It's like you can "predict" the future so you could take the right steps in developing your businesses.
